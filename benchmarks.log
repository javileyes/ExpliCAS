Benchmark Results - 2025-12-02
Commit: 3751a96 "mejoras" (with local optimizations)

calculus/diff_nested_trig_exp: 43.67 µs
rational/sum_fractions_10: 332.05 µs
polynomial/expand_binomial_power_10: 211.67 µs
solver/solve_quadratic: 32.88 µs
stress/deeply_nested_poly: 740.37 µs
trigonometry/pythagorean_identity_nested: 4.82 ms

Notes:
- diff_nested_trig_exp improved significantly (previously ~273 µs) due to simplify_polynomial heuristic.
