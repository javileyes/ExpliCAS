8. Solve factor: x - 1 = 0
   -> -1 + x = 0
9. Subtract -1 from both sides
   -> x = 1
10. Solve factor: x - 2 = 0
   -> -2 + x = 0
11. Subtract -2 from both sides
   -> x = 2
12. Solve factor: x - 3 = 0
   -> -3 + x = 0
13. Subtract -3 from both sides
   -> x = 3
14. Solve factor: x - 4 = 0
   -> -4 + x = 0
15. Subtract -4 from both sides
   -> x = 4
16. Solve factor: x - 5 = 0
   -> -5 + x = 0
17. Subtract -5 from both sides
   -> x = 5
Result: { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
Simplification Steps:
Solving simplified equation: (-1 + x) / (1 + x) + (1 + x) / (-1 + x) = 2
Steps:
1. Subtract (1 + x) / (-1 + x) from both sides
   -> (-1 + x) / (1 + x) = 2 - (1 + x) / (-1 + x)
2. Multiply both sides by 1 + x
   -> -1 + x = (1 + x) * (2 - (1 + x) / (-1 + x))
3. Subtract -1 from both sides
   -> x = 1 + (1 + x) * (2 - (1 + x) / (-1 + x))
Result: {  }
