//! Equation-level additive term cancellation utilities.
//!
//! Provides `cancel_common_additive_terms()`, which compares terms from
//! two expression trees (LHS and RHS of an equation) and cancels matching
//! pairs using structural comparison.
//!
//! # Why this is NOT a simplifier rule
//!
//! The simplifier's `CanonicalizeNegationRule` converts `Sub(a, b)` to
//! `Add(a, Neg(b))` very early in the pipeline. A rule targeting `Sub`
//! nodes would never fire because the Sub is already gone.
//!
//! More fundamentally, equation-level cancellation is a **relational
//! operation** between two expression trees (LHS vs RHS of `lhs = rhs`).
//! A simplifier rule only sees a single expression node. These are
//! different abstractions and belong in different layers.
//!
//! # Preconditions
//!
//! For maximum effectiveness, both `lhs` and `rhs` should be in
//! canonical form before calling:
//! - Rational exponents: `Div(Number(p), Number(q))` → `Number(p/q)`
//!   (via CanonicalizeRationalDivRule)
//! - Flattened Add/Mul chains with stable ordering
//!   (via standard canonicalization rules)
//!
//! # Guarantees
//!
//! - **Strictly reductive**: total term count always decreases
//! - **Sound**: uses `compare_expr` for structural equality (no numeric
//!   approximation)
//! - **Deterministic**: order of cancellation is fixed (rhs terms scanned
//!   in order, matched against lhs terms in order)

/// Semantic fallback for equation-level term cancellation.

/// **2-phase candidate+proof pattern for soundness:**
///
/// 1. *Candidate generation* (Generic domain): normalize both sides
///    (split fractions, distribute scalar multiplication, split log
///    products/sqrt), then simplify each term with Generic domain to
///    expose structure (allows `x/x → 1`, etc.).
///
/// 2. *Pair proof* (Strict domain): for each candidate pair, verify
///    `simplify_strict(l - r) == 0` before cancelling. This ensures
///    the cancellation doesn't depend on unproven assumptions (e.g.,
///    `x ≠ 0` for `x/x → 1`). The Generic simplification only exposes
///    candidates; Strict validates them.
///
/// # Guards
/// - ≤ `MAX_TERMS` terms per side (avoids O(n²) explosion)
/// - ≤ `MAX_NODES` nodes per term (avoids expensive simplification)
